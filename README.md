# Maya_and_Python
Learning how to code in python while learning about maya; and how to use the two together.

My name is James McKenna, I'm a beginner level software engineer that is trying to make projects and build up skills via python.
Currently I'm working on learning how to use Maya with Python and how the two go together for various projects within the entertainment industry.
I have begun making simple scripts as well as other projects inside of the general editor in Maya; that uses Python.
I'm uploading all the scripts that I do make into this repository for anyone that is wanting to see what I'm making and how I'm coding it via Python.
I'm also commenting all the scripts that I make, that way it not only shows my own comprehension, but helps with anyone else; so they don't have to open Maya in order to figure out the code I'm making.

Thank you so much for checking out my beginning work and I hope to speak with you soon!

Very Respectfully,
James McKenna
