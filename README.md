# Maya_and_Python
Learning how to code in python while learning about maya; and how to use the two together.

My name is James McKenna, I'm a beginner level software engineer that is trying to make projects and build up skills via python.
Currently I'm working on learning how to use Maya with Python and how the two go together for various projects within the entertainment industry.
Thank you so much for checking out my beginning work and I hope to speak with you soon!

Very Respectfully,
James McKenna
